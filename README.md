# FindCoord
This searches the WorldPainter map for a specific point that matches the user input.

The arguments available are:
```
"lowHeight" = finds the first coordinate with the lowest height.
"highHeight" = finds the first coordinate with the highest height.
"lowSlope" = finds the first coordinate with the lowest slope.
"highHeight" = finds the first coordinate with the highest slope.
```
If you add the word "All", it lists all coordinates with the given input.
